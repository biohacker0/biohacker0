ðŸ‘‹ Hey, itâ€™s meâ€”uhh, hi!
Iâ€™m a JavaScript developer with over 3 years of experience, working across its framework ecosystem. I started as a frontend engineer and now focus on infrastructure and toolingâ€”building solutions for compute-heavy workloads, like orchestrating ML pipelines, optimizing GPU clusters, and automating deployments at scale.

I enjoy working on **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Full-Stack Systems**, with a particular interest in infrastructure. Iâ€™m passionate about making systems run faster âš¡, simplifying complexity, and creating efficient solutions, whether in self-hosted or cloud-native environments.

ðŸ’» I love tackling challenges in system design and optimization. Letâ€™s build a faster, simpler web together!
